# Capstone Project: Work It Out

An application to create workouts based on your available equipment and the muscles you want to train.
<br> In the app you can create , delete and edit a workout with several different exercises.
<br>Exercises can be filtert in order to specific musclegrupps. The app also has a calendar view in
<br>which it is possible to get an overview of workouts that are finished. 
<br>In the background of our app there is a MongoDB database in which user data and created workouts are stored
<br>The WorkItOut is provided with a login, so the data of the users can only be seen in a password-protected area.
